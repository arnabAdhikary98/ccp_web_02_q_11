# Basic Styling with CSS

## Problem Statement

Create a simple HTML page and style it using CSS selectors and properties learned from the lesson. Your webpage should include:

- Two paragraphs with different styles:
  - One paragraph should have a blue text color and 20px font size.
  - The second paragraph should have a green text color and 18px font size.
- Two headings: Use `h1` and `h2` elements with different text colors (e.g., navy for `h1` and dark red for `h2`).
- Page Background: Set the background color of the entire page to a light gray color.
